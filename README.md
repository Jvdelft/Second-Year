# Second Year Projects
Those are the projects of my second year of Bachelor. I will briefly explain each of them in the following sections.

# Cylinder Robot Sorter
This project was focused on the creation of a robot able to sort based on the size cylinders of three different diameters.
It consisted of development of control laws and designing of electronics and mechanical components. More details can be found in the final report and presentation.
However, one should note that those are in French only.

# Java RPG Game
The objective was to create a RPG-like game in Java using object oriented coding. The game should have several functions such as saves, musics, damaga, hunger and so on.
The code, the sequence diagrams and the final report can be found in the folder.
Once again, as it was in my second year of bachelor, the report is only in French.
